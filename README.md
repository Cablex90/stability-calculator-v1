# satbility-calculator-v1
a simple and fast calculator for bullet stability. i've tested this formula with several different loads and calibers and it works.
this thing saved me much money, evertime before u boy some ammo calculate it and u will find the best for your gun, without buying and testing them.
its an efficient way to find the right ammo for your gun or if u do handloads u can match the speed and grain u want to your barrel and see if it is efficient.
i'm working on an v2 with a full database from every bullet, but this take long and im not a softzware developer all of this i learned by myself as often as i got some spare time left.

thanks :)
